strategy:
We only need to circle around 10 tiles. The "circle" is a 3x4 diagonal square.
There are three advantages:
1. When we get to the last tile in our cicrle, the first tile can be harvested. So we get the time efficiency;
2. No need to put out a fire. Because we WILL DEFINITELY get to the tile which is on fire in a relatively short time  as we are circleling. Puting out a fire on a tile which locates outside of our route will instead be a waste of time. More importantly, in case of a fire, the fire will not spread on our other tiles as all the tiles are located on the diagonal line.
3.  When we are circleling, if the tile is owned by the enemy bot, we can just set that tile on fire  and move on. 

In all, our stratedy is "coping with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle".
