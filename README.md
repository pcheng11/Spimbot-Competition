# Spimbot-Competition
A SPIMbot that will compete with other SPIMbots in the strangeland.
SPIMbot believe it could survive with its newfound agricultural skills. However, as soon as SPIMbot settled in, the distantlyrelated bots
showed their true colors. It had become increasingly clear to SPIMbotâ€™s cousins that it wouldbe impossible for both species of SPIMbot to 
live in this land, with limited land and resources. SPIMbotmust compete against other SPIMbot species, in a fight for survival. Our bot 
must harvest as much food foritself as possible, and may even sabotage the enemy bot. Furthermore, resources are extremely limited, 
andSPIMbot will only be able to retrieve resources from the mysterious crop and agricultural buildings thatare in this strange land. These 
buildings are locked, and SPIMbot can only unlock the resources in thesebuildings by completing KenKen challenges.
